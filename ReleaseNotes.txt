	<p>This module has a single purpose to insert and/or update 4 PortalSettings required by a scheduled task to delete and/or optionally purge Unauthorised users.</p>
	<p>Unauthorised users can be deleted a specified time period after they have been registered. This is designed to help in the fight against Spam Registrations. It is reasonable to assume that if a user does not verify theiir email address within 60 minutes (default value) that they are not genuine.</p>
	<p>An additional option is to purge (remove from the database) anu users flagged as deleted. The default timespan for purging deleted users is 7 days. This gives a site administrator the ability to un-delete and authorise any users that may have been deleted in error.</p>
